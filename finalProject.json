  "commentsForGrader": "There are two videos in the panopto link. The first is an overview of the website, and the second is a more in-depth look at a couple source files. This project was based around my research, for which I'm building a website. The project is relatively large, but incomplete. It involves connections to a Python Flask server, but the code for that is not included here. All my code is on Github rather than Gitlab."
